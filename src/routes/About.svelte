<h4 class="section-header">ABOUT</h4>
<p>
	Back in 2019, I decided to take a leap of faith and transitioned to become a software engineer
	from a career in mechanical engineering. I was fueled by a deep passion for coding and a
	relentless drive to delve into the world of software development. Through extensive self-learning,
	dedicated courses, and immersive projects, I equipped myself with the necessary skills to thrive
	in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.
	<br /><br />
	All of these are possible because of the continuous support I get from my
	<span style="color:white">family</span> and <span style="color:white">friends</span>.
